# GQ-corr

This project aims to determine any dependencies of PQS (putative quadruplex sequences) locations on non-transcriptional factors. Calculations are made for human genome (hg38), by chromosome.

Python script PQS_type.py enumerates G-quadruplexes divided into categories by loop length. File PQS_g2corr.py is used to calculate pair correlation function (PCF) of the PQS locations.
